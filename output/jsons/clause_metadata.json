OTHER REMEDIES AND RIGHTS. The termination rights set forth herein shall not constitute the exclusive remedy of the non-defaulting party. Termination in accordance with the above provisions shall be without prejudice to any rights or claims, which the terminating party may otherwise have against the defaulting party. In the event of any arbitration or litigation, including breach, enforcement or interpretation, arising out of this Agreement, the prevailing party of such litigation shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and expenses, including pre-litigation and appellate attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. 15. FORCE MAJEUR. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, neither Party will be liable for any delay in the performance of any of its obligations if such delay is caused by any reason wholly outside the control of the Party so delaying (a \u201cForce Majeur Event\u201d) subject to the obligation of the Party so delaying promptly notifying the other Party in writing of the reasons for the delay and the likely duration of the delay. The performance of such Party\u2019s obligations will be suspended during the period that the Force Majeur Event persists and such Party will be granted an extension of time for performance equal to the period of the delay. If the delay referred to above exceeds sixty (60) days (or such other reasonable period taking into consideration the nature and cause of the delay), either Party may forthwith terminate this Agreement whereupon the Parties shall cease to be bound by their respective obligations under this Agreement in respect granted under this Agreement shall cease."

Developer further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Franchisor from all said Losses and shall pay for and be responsible for all said Losses, however caused, whether by any individual, employee, third person or party, vendor, visitor, invitee, trespasser or any firm or corporation whatsoever, whether caused by or contributed to by Franchisor, the combined conduct of Developer and Franchisor, or active or passive negligence of Franchisor, but for the sole negligence or willful misconduct of Franchisor. 14.
